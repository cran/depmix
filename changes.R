Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

1) Added case replicate-weights to save computational load in fitting
latent class models on categorical data.  Markovdata now has an extra
argument which can be used to provide the number of replicates for each
case. 

2) Updated references and added a introductory document on using depmix
called depmix-intro.
