Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

1) Added case replicate-weights to save computational load in fitting
latent class models on categorical data.  Markovdata now has an extra
argument which can be used to provide the number of replicates for each
case. 

2) Updated references and added a vignette called depmix-intro. 

Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2 

No changes except the addition that the package is now ORPHANED; this is 
an automatic change in the CRAN repositories because warnings occur.


Changes from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3 

Optimization is by default done using optim and reparametrization and a
penalty function for the inequality constraints; however the use of the
Rdonlp2 package by Tamura is highly recommended as it deals with general
linear constraints much better (optional support for NPSOL also still
exists); the major advantage of this is that donlp2 handles general linear
constraints without problems.
